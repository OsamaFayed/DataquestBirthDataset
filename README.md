# DataquestBirthDataset
My Solution is to analysis births from 1994-2000 in dataset set provided by DataQuest
dif = get_dif(cdc_year_births, 1994, 2002)
here is the some functions to calculate some statistics:
Get the min and max of births per year
number of births for each year
number of births for the day of month 
number of births for the day of week
number of births for the same month
